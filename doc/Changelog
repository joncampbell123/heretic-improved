future
* SDL module with SDLsound (esd)
* more game resolutions - stability tests

1.02 -> 1.03 (27.12.1999)
* multiple game resolutions !!! (-mode width height)
* SDL version (video only; sound via pipes from other procs)
* bug fixes in several files
* fastx11-module changed

1.01 -> 1.02 (25.11.1999)
* bug fixes in BIG_ENDIAN macros

1.0 -> 1.01 (23.10.1999)
(done by Douglas Paul:)
* merged the arm and std header-files into a single one
* the __attribute__ ((packed)) statements are now handled by the preprocessor,
  this way, any future changes shouldn't break the ARM version
* made some changes that will allow the wadfile and servers to be in
  the path (or, for the wadfile in ../share/heretic from anything on the
  path.)
* it is possible now to build a working RPM

1.0beta2 -> 1.0 final (20.08.1999)
* GGI beta2 is supported
* small bugfixes in graphics engine
* minor fixes in SVGAlib module
* ambient-sound-fixes (some sounds arn´t too loud any more)
* compile fixes for LinuxPPC
* old dependencies are deleted with 'make distclean'
* X-shm code minor changes
* disabled filtering (linear/bilinear) by default
* x mouse-code changes

1.0beta1 -> 1.0beta2 (14.04.1999)
* Heretic runs on Alpha-machines now ! (code is 64bit-clean)
* now possible to use original '[' and ']' keys for inventory access instead
  of 'k' and 'l', if "-DORIG_INVKEYS" defined in Makefile
* background run (SVGALib version only) support; vgaeretic will run
  on the background, while you're switched off the console it runs on.
  This can for example save network game from loosing client connection.
  Background running is allowed by default. To disable this behaviour,
  specify "-nobgrun" commandline switch and pass it as parameter to vgaheretic.
* mouse sensitivity regulation now works within the full range
  (0-100%)
* while in demo modes, the main menu pop-up is now possible only through
  the ESC key
* Heretic-home(~/.heretic) directory permissions are now solved
  (If vgaheretic is started as suid-root by a user, then he will be
   the owner of the (~/.heretic)-directory.)
* some or more bug-fixes

0.9.5 -> 1.0beta1 (26.03.1999)
* Music support via the lxdoom-musserver and a updated soundclient
  (Now music works with standart OPL3, Midi-wavetable and
  AWE32-Midi (sounds great))
* several network fixes (IPX and UDP) - now it would be displayed if a player 
  quits a game
* Heretic now works an a Netwinder (ARM) and on a SCO-Unix
  machine (happy Sysadmins :-))
* some new graphic-feautures like linear and bilinear filtering within
  all graphic targets (X11/GGI/VGA)
* fastX11 - a new graphic-target has been written, but it works only on
  x86 machines yet -> it doubles the fps-speed against the x11 target even
  in truecolor-mode !

0.9.3 -> 0.9.5: (13.02.1999)
* UDP-network games are stable now !! You can play with up to four players
  over the net now. (eight players are possible; only change MAYPLAYERS
  in doomdef.h)
* IPX-network games really should work from this time on ! Now it is possible
  to play netgames over IPX even with the original DOS-Heretic.
* GGI updates (optimized scaling, minor keyboard fixes, doublebuffering on
  DirectBuffer improved (now it works in fullscreen at least), merged with
  LinuxDoom GGI code).
* Initial support for higher resolutions (automap, menus, statusbar and 
  info screens work flawlessly now, but the 3d engine gets messed up or
  crashes if vertical resolution exceeds 240. Horizontal resolutions are
  limited to the common ones - 320, 512, 640, 800 and 1024 all work fine
  but most inbetween causes crashes.)
* Removed the evil busywaiting - usleep() when idle to free up CPU time on
  fast machines.
* Support for compiling with GSI sound (but it doesn't work right now).
* Namespace fixes
* introduced new file handling => the env. HERETICHOME can be set and the WAD will
  be searched in this directory
* the WAD can be copied into the homedir (~/.heretic) and will be found there at last
* geometry patches in i.x11.c => the standard flags '-display' and '-geometry'
  will work now
* introduced dependency-checking in the Makefile

0.9.2 -> 0.9.3: (02.02.1999)
* No need for a -D__GLIBC2__ in Makefile any more; the c-library is
  automatically detected.
* Fixes in p_enemy.c => workaround for gcc (2.7.2.3 ??) enum-bug.
* Fixes in d_net.c and i_udp.c => You can start now two Heretic-net-sessions
  on one machine.
* Fixes in i_vga.c => MOUSE_INTELLIMOUSE and MOUSE_IMPS2 are now supported.
* minor BIG_ENDIAN fixes.
* Fixes in mn_menu.c => the game doesn't crash any more if you press F1
  several times in E3M8
* Fixes in in_lude.c => the game-intermission screen isn't in disorder 
  on BIG_ENDIAN-machines any more.
* All the user-specific files (savegames/config-file) are kept in the 
  homedirectory	(~/.heretic/) now.

0.9.1.1 -> 0.9.2: (23.01.1999)
* Sfx-sound works now ! There is asynchronous sound managed my a seperate
  process which communicates with Heretic through a pipe.

0.9.1 -> 0.9.1.1: (21.01.1999)
* GGI updates: 
        - Now uses DirectBuffer when available and works properly when it is 
         not. 
        - Support for scaling by a factor of 2. (-scale switch)
        - Support for 8, 15, 16 and 32 bpp modes (24 can be achieved with the 
         palemu target) 
* Proper keyboard handling (the cheats work now ;) 
* Simple FPS meter for GGI and X11 versions. 
* Fixes in routine P_FindNextHighestFloor()

0.9.0 -> 0.9.1:	(19.01.1999)
It is now possible to compile and run Heretic for X11 under 
Linux/x86, Linux/m68k and FreeBSD. (Alpha doesn't work now.)
(I can't say anything about Linux/Sparc and other Linux-ports)
Added SVGA Version. (code by Nic, see AUTHORS)

0.9.0 => First public release. (18.01.1999)
